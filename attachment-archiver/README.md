# Attachment Archiver

Automatically intercept emails to the active user's inbox and, based on certain rules, route message attachments to a specified Google Drive folder. Once messages are processed, they are marked as read and archived.

Script links up with a Google Sheet to interpret and process rules, which can be added without updating the script.
